# dv-jobpicker-redux

Select the types of jobs you want and never see the ones you don't. No shunting jobs? All shunting jobs? (Are you a masochist?) This allows the game to generate more jobs of the types you desire.

> [!NOTE]
> Any setting changes to the mod while playing will only be applied when you load a save game and then visit a new station.

Lets you select which jobs you want generated. (Load/Unload Shunting, Freight, or Logistic) Also lets you customize the minimum number of cars per job.

### SETTINGS:

- Load Types: Check or uncheck the option next to the jobs you do or do not want to generate.
- Minimum Cars: The minimum consist length. Recommended setting no greater than 5. There are only a few stations where track length is available for longer trains; so the number of jobs will diminish if set too high.
- Use Storage and Output Tracks: Freight jobs only spawn on output rails, and logistic jobs spawn on storage rails. This option combines the two sets of tracks for more job options. With the option enabled (recommended) you can have freight or logistics spawn on both output and storage rails.
